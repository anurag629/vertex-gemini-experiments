# Gemini App Playground

## Overview
This is a demo application built using the Vertex AI Gemini API that showcases the power of generative AI. The app allows users to interact with both **Gemini 1.0 Pro** (for natural language tasks) and **Gemini 1.0 Pro Vision** (for multimodal tasks) models. 

The application is built using **Streamlit**, a Python-based web application framework, and deployed to **Google Cloud Run**. It demonstrates various use cases of the Vertex AI Gemini models, including generating stories, marketing campaigns, image and video processing, and more.

## Features
- **Story Generation**: Create personalized stories based on user input.
- **Marketing Campaign Generation**: Automatically generate marketing campaigns for products.
- **Image Playground**: Analyze and process images, generate recommendations, and extract information from visual layouts.
- **Video Playground**: Analyze videos, generate tags, descriptions, and extract geolocation data.
- **Cloud-Hosted**: The app is containerized with Docker and deployed on Google Cloud Run for scalability.

## Technology Stack
- **Vertex AI Gemini API**:
  - **Gemini 1.0 Pro**: For text-based tasks such as story and marketing campaign generation.
  - **Gemini 1.0 Pro Vision**: For multimodal tasks involving text, images, and videos.
- **Streamlit**: A Python framework for creating web applications.
- **Google Cloud**:
  - **Cloud Run**: For serverless deployment.
  - **Artifact Registry**: For managing Docker containers.
  - **Cloud Build**: For building Docker images.
- **Docker**: Containerization for easy deployment.
  
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. **Google Cloud Account**: Ensure you have a Google Cloud account with appropriate billing enabled.
2. **Google Cloud SDK**: Install [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) if not already installed.
3. **Docker**: Install Docker for building and managing containers.
4. **Streamlit**: This application uses Streamlit for the frontend, ensure it's installed with:
   ```
   pip install streamlit
   ```

### Setup & Installation

#### 1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/gemini-app-playground.git
cd gemini-app-playground
```

#### 2. Set up Python environment:
Create and activate a Python virtual environment.
```bash
python3 -m venv gemini-streamlit
source gemini-streamlit/bin/activate
```

#### 3. Install dependencies:
Install the required dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 4. Set up Google Cloud Project:
Make sure your Google Cloud project is set up and you have the correct permissions. Run the following commands in **Google Cloud Shell**:
```bash
gcloud auth list
gcloud config list project
```

#### 5. Enable the required APIs:
```bash
gcloud services enable cloudbuild.googleapis.com cloudfunctions.googleapis.com run.googleapis.com logging.googleapis.com storage-component.googleapis.com aiplatform.googleapis.com
```

#### 6. Create a Docker container for the app:
```bash
gcloud builds submit --tag "$REGION-docker.pkg.dev/$PROJECT_ID/$AR_REPO/$SERVICE_NAME"
```

#### 7. Deploy the app to Cloud Run:
```bash
gcloud run deploy "$SERVICE_NAME" \
  --port=8080 \
  --image="$REGION-docker.pkg.dev/$PROJECT_ID/$AR_REPO/$SERVICE_NAME" \
  --allow-unauthenticated \
  --region=$REGION \
  --platform=managed \
  --project=$PROJECT_ID \
  --set-env-vars=PROJECT_ID=$PROJECT_ID,REGION=$REGION
```

#### 8. Access the App:
Once deployed, you will be given a URL to access the app. Open it in a browser to interact with the app.

### Running the App Locally
To run the app locally with **Streamlit**, use the following command:
```bash
streamlit run app.py --server.port=8080
```
You can then access the app by going to `http://localhost:8080` in your web browser.

## Use Cases
- **Creative Storytelling**: Input character traits and generate a personalized story.
- **Marketing Campaigns**: Generate full-fledged marketing campaigns tailored to your product and target audience.
- **Image Processing**: Get recommendations or extract details from images like room designs, diagrams, or UI layouts.
- **Video Understanding**: Extract tags, highlights, geolocation, and summaries from videos using the Gemini multimodal model.

## Deployment
The application is deployed on **Google Cloud Run**, ensuring that it's scalable and can handle multiple user requests simultaneously.

### Building & Deploying:
1. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   gcloud builds submit --tag "$REGION-docker.pkg.dev/$PROJECT_ID/$AR_REPO/$SERVICE_NAME"
   ```
2. Deploy to Cloud Run:
   ```bash
   gcloud run deploy "$SERVICE_NAME" \
   --port=8080 \
   --image="$REGION-docker.pkg.dev/$PROJECT_ID/$AR_REPO/$SERVICE_NAME" \
   --allow-unauthenticated \
   --region=$REGION \
   --platform=managed \
   --project=$PROJECT_ID
   ```
